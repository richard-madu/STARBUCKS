    "# Starbucks Capstone Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to combine transaction, demographic and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type. This data set is a simplified version of the real Starbucks app because the underlying simulator only has one product whereas Starbucks actually sells dozens of products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every offer has a validity period before the offer expires. As an example, a BOGO offer might be valid for only 5 days. You'll see in the data set that informational offers have a validity period even though these ads are merely providing information about a product; for example, if an informational offer has 7 days of validity, you can assume the customer is feeling the influence of the offer for 7 days after receiving the advertisement.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be given transactional data showing user purchases made on the app including the timestamp of purchase and the amount of money spent on a purchase. This transactional data also has a record for each offer that a user receives as well as a record for when a user actually views the offer. There are also records for when a user completes an offer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind as well that someone using the app might make a purchase through the app without having received an offer or seen an offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "To give an example, a user could receive a discount offer buy 10 dollars get 2 off on Monday. The offer is valid for 10 days from receipt. If the customer accumulates at least 10 dollars in purchases during the validity period, the customer completes the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are a few things to watch out for in this data set. Customers do not opt into the offers that they receive; in other words, a user can receive an offer, never actually view the offer, and still complete the offer. For example, a user might receive the \"buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer\", but the user never opens the offer during the 10 day validity period. The customer spends 15 dollars during those ten days. There will be an offer completion record in the data set; however, the customer was not influenced by the offer because the customer never viewed the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes data cleaning especially important and tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also want to take into account that some demographic groups will make purchases even if they don't receive an offer. From a business perspective, if a customer is going to make a 10 dollar purchase without an offer anyway, you wouldn't want to send a buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer. You'll want to try to assess what a certain demographic group will buy when not receiving any offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Advice\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is a capstone project, you are free to analyze the data any way you see fit. For example, you could build a machine learning model that predicts how much someone will spend based on demographics and offer type. Or you could build a model that predicts whether or not someone will respond to an offer. Or, you don't need to build a machine learning model at all. You could develop a set of heuristics that determine what offer you should send to each customer (i.e., 75 percent of women customers who were 35 years old responded to offer A vs 40 percent from the same demographic to offer B, so send offer A)."

    "# Data Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is contained in three files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)\n",
    "* profile.json - demographic data for each customer\n",
    "* transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the schema and explanation of each variable in the files:\n",
    "\n",
    "**portfolio.json**\n",
    "* id (string) - offer id\n",
    "* offer_type (string) - type of offer ie BOGO, discount, informational\n",
    "* difficulty (int) - minimum required spend to complete an offer\n",
    "* reward (int) - reward given for completing an offer\n",
    "* duration (int) - time for offer to be open, in days\n",
    "* channels (list of strings)\n",
    "\n",
    "**profile.json**\n",
    "* age (int) - age of the customer \n",
    "* became_member_on (int) - date when customer created an app account\n",
    "* gender (str) - gender of the customer (note some entries contain 'O' for other rather than M or F)\n",
    "* id (str) - customer id\n",
    "* income (float) - customer's income\n",
    "\n",
    "**transcript.json**\n",
    "* event (str) - record description (ie transaction, offer received, offer viewed, etc.)\n",
    "* person (str) - customer id\n",
    "* time (int) - time in hours since start of test. The data begins at time t=0\n",
    "* value - (dict of strings) - either an offer id or transaction amount depending on the record\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you are using the workspace, you will need to go to the terminal and run the command `conda update pandas` before reading in the files. This is because the version of pandas in the workspace cannot read in the transcript.json file correctly, but the newest version of pandas can. You can access the termnal from the orange icon in the top left of this notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can see how to access the terminal and how the install works using the two images below.  First you need to access the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pic1.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you will want to run the above command:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pic2.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, when you enter back into the notebook (use the jupyter icon again), you should be able to run the below cell without any errors."

    "## PROJECT STRATEGY\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project I would be making a four classifiers models and selecting the one with an accuracy score that is higher than 80%. Before modeling I would be scaling and standardising some of the numerical data with standard scaler and PCA The classification models that I would be using are;\n",
    "\n",
    "    >K-Nearest Neighbour: Based on a given number (k) of the closest surrounding data points, the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) method makes predictions. The pre-processing of the data is important in this case since it directly affects the distance measurements. For the data pre-processing stage, I would be standardising the data using standard scaler. The model, unlike others, lacks both a mathematical formula and any descriptive capabilities.\n",

    "    > Ada Boost Classifier: Yoav Freund and Robert Schapire proposed the Ada-boost or Adaptive Boosting ensemble boosting classifier in 1996. To improve classifier accuracy, it combines many classifiers. An iterative ensemble algorithm is AdaBoost. AdaBoost classifier combines a number of ineffective classifiers to create a powerful classifier that has a high degree of accuracy. The fundamental idea underlying Adaboost is to train the data sample and adjust the classifier weights in each iteration in a way that provides accurate predictions of uncommon observations. Any machine learning algorithm can be used as base classifier if it accepts weights on the training set. Adaboost should meet two conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "        *The classifier should be trained interactively on various weighed training examples.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        *In each iteration, it tries to provide an excellent fit for these examples by minimizing training error.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    > Random Forest Classifier: A Random Forest is a trustworthy combination of many Decision Trees (or CARTs), albeit it is more frequently used in classification applications than in regression ones. The individual trees in this case are separated using fewer features and generated using bagging (i.e., the aggregation of bootstraps, which are nothing more than numerous train datasets created by sampling of records with replacement). The diversified forest of uncorrelated trees that results from this has less variation, making it more resistant to data change and retaining its prediction accuracy for new data.\n",
    "    Nevertheless, the technique struggles with datasets with a high number of outliers, which must be fixed before developing the model.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    > Naive Bayes: While we might not be aware of it, the algorithm that is most frequently employed to sort through spam emails!\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Bayes Theorem is used to apply a posterior probability in order to categorize the unstructured data. And in doing so, it makes the potentially false assumption that the predictors are independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "    As long as all of the categorical predictor's classes are available, the model may be trained using a little training dataset.\n",

    "Feature scaling is a method used to normalize the range of independent variables or features of data. In data processing, it is also known as data normalization and is generally performed during the data preprocessing step. For this project I would be using the StandardScaler. StandardScaler standardizes a feature by subtracting the mean and then scaling to unit variance. Unit variance means dividing all the values by the standard deviation."

Some hyperparameter tuning can help in improving thr model. I would suggest using grid search as hyperparameter tuner. This is because it is simple to compute and since it does not compute all the hyperparameter combination it is optimises the time spent in tuning."

    "## CONCLUSION\n",
    "\n",
    "This project investigates three simulated data from Starbucks and uses a machine learning algorithm to make predictions. First, the individual datasets were explored and all cleanliness and tidiness issues are resolved then the three data sets were combined into a single data frame. The data is scaled using a standard scaler. Before creating the model a few feature engineering processes were carried and some categorical variables were encoded with numbers. Finally, I built a machine learning model to make train, test and made predictions. The first model predicted the events variable, the event variable is divided into three; offer received, offer viewed, and offer complete. This variable is used to track the customer's response to the offer they are given. The machine learning models used are KNN, Ada boost, Random Forest and Naive Bayes. All the models fell short of the required accuracy score of 80%. The second model predicts if the customer completes his offer. I used the same group of ML models and they fell short of the accuracy score threshold. I then created a logistic regression model to see how the offer complete relates to other variables. There is a positive relationship between the offer complete variable and the income, gender, duration and time. This means that as customers' income increases the more likely they are to complete their orders. Also, there is a negative relationship between age, difficulty and the offer type. The difficulty is the minimum amount a customer has to spend before they get an offer. The result of the regression model shows that offers with higher difficulty are less likely to be completed.\n",
    "However, the logistic regression model has an R square of negative infinity which means that the model does fit the data.\n"
